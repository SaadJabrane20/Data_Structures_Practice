# Data Structures Practice

This repository contains my implementations of classic data structures in **C, C++, and Python**.  
The goal is to practice and understand core concepts across different programming languages.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- `C/` â†’ Implementations in C (manual memory management, structs)
- `Cpp/` â†’ Implementations in C++ (OOP, STL usage)
- `Python/` â†’ Implementations in Python (built-in lists, classes)

## âœ… Implemented
- Stack (array & linked list)
- Queue (array, linked list, circular queue)
- Linked List (singly & doubly)
- Binary Tree & BST
- Graph (BFS & DFS)
- Heap

## ðŸš€ Next Steps
- Add Hash Table implementation
- Add AVL Tree
- Add Trie
